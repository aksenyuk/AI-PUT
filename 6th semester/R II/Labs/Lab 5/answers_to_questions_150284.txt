1. What is the role of the transpose layer after input? 

To convert NHWC (tensorflow) input format into NCHW (onnx).

2. What is the role of the GlobalAveragePool layer after the last Concat layer?

To enforce correspondences between feature maps and classes.
Before performing the pooling, we have feature maps with the "whitest" pixels indicating finding a feature-like element on an image. Therefore, once the pooling is done, i.e., an average of all pixels in each feature map is computed and returned as a single element, the correct class will correspond to the element of a highest value; and the spacial dimension is reduced (5x48x2x1 -> 5x48x1x1).
